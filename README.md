# Dweet.me Scriptable Widget
Shows status of the latest dweet as a widget on a phone using the [Scriptable app](https://scriptable.app/).

It uses the Scriptable app to place a scriptable widget on the Home or Lock screen.

This Dweet.me widget is written in JavaScript, so this can be adapted outside the app.
