# Dweet.me Scriptable iPhone Home Screen Widget
Shows status of the latest dweet as a widget on a phone using the [Scriptable app](https://scriptable.app/).

Ready-built way to add widgets to iOS that fetch and display a content key value from a dweet.me topic feed.
It uses the Scriptable app to place a scriptable widget on the Home or Lock Screen.

Some cool features:
- **Multiple Home Screen widgets** to monitor different Dweet topics and/or key values by changing the Parameter values in the Home Screen (see instructions below)!
- Works with the iPhone's Light Mode and Dark Mode.
- JavaScript open source so you can modify as you see fit and even modified outside the app (browser, Android, Chromebook, etc.).
